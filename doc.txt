NAME 
	nametime -- rename files using their creation timestamp

SYNOSPSIS 
	nametime [-rtf][-e pattern][-o [x,s]]
	nametime -h

DESCRIPTION
	The nametime script allows to rename files, using their creation time, if the filesystem
	does not support creation time, nametime will use their modification time, so be careful.
	It's highly reccomended to use the quotes for paths. Soft links are not considered.

	The command line options are as follows:

	-e 'pattern' -> rename only the files in directories that matches (eregex) with 'pattern'

	-r -> search recursively into directories (it must be given if a directories is passed as an argument)
	
	-t -> creates a file (oldnames.txt) in the cwd that store the old name values in this way:
			oldname ---> newname
			file         20201020
	
	-f -> format all the files' name in standard unix but does not rename them with their timestamp

	-o '[x,s]' -> the default mode is **-o 's'**, so if a directory has not the right permission it ask the
	user the permission to change the permission. With the option 'x' it just changes the permission
	
	-h -> help menu  

SIDE EFFECTS
		-every file is renamed in unix standard

FILES
	${cwd}/oldnames.txt		Where the oldnames are saved

EXIT STATUS
	
	0 if there's no error and no ignored files
	1 if the script is not invoked correctly
	x where x is the number of ignored files

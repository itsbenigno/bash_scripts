## Nametime - A nice way of renaming photos

As its name suggests, this script lets you rename files using their creation date. 

I find it particularly useful for photos and video that have sequential names (e.g. 002.jpg). 
Using this script I can retain the creation date that is often lost as you switch between filesystems, 
and use it to sort my photos by name (since of course now the name is the date, so something like
2010_02_14).

You can rename all the photos (or files) in a folder, and can also select only specific types of files
if you know regex expression. 

You can find all the features and its usage in the doc.txt file.
